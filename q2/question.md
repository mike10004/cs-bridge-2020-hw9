# Question 2

Two strings are anagrams if the letters can be rearranged to form each other. For example,
“Eleven plus two” is an anagram of “Twelve plus one”. Each string contains one ‘v’, three ‘e’s,
two ‘l’s, etc.

Write a program that determines if two strings are anagrams. The program should not be case
sensitive and should disregard any punctuation or spaces.

## Notes

1. Think how to break down your implementation to functions.
2. Pay attention to the running time of your program. If each input string contains n
   characters, an efficient implementation would run in a linear time (that is Θ(n)).
